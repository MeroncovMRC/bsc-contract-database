    GMR FINANCE! THE PLAN!
    
    NON-FUNGIBLE TOKEN (NFT'S)
    Content Creators, Game Developers & Gaming Platforms will be able to create, showcase and sell personal NFT's on our platform. Converting clips etc into NFT's will be available with just a few clicks. A non-fungible token is a unit of data stored on a digital ledger, called a blockchain, that certifies a digital asset to be unique and therefore not interchangeable. NFTs can be used to represent items such as photos, videos, audio, and other types of digital files.
    
    GAMER VAULT
    Our gamer vault will be a place for everyone. You will be able to create your own profile, follow your favourite game categories. follow your favourite content creators and channels, support streamers & creators directly using GMR, enter competitions and tournaments. leaderboards with profiles, GMR lottery, live stream integrations and much much more.
    
    TOURNAMENTS & COMPETITIONS
    GMR Finance will be hosting a huge selection of tournaments and competitions across all gaming categories and platforms to win prizes of upto $20,000. Take on your favourite creators with a competitive edge. Platform battles will also be a thing. Twitch, YouTube, Facebook who wins?
    
    LOTTERY
    You will be able to purchase GMR lottery tickets with GMR to potentially win huge GMR prizes. This will also have a burn feature reducing our total supply.
    
    PARTNERSHIPS
    We have already started talking to Streamers, YouTubers & Developers. Platform partnerships are also under revision.
    
    GAME KEYS
    HODLing GMR will give gamers access to discounted keys for all platforms such as Xbox, PlayStation, Steam, Amazon and more.
    
    LIQUIDITY POOL
    Our GAMER VAULT will be packed with extra features for anyone adding to our liquidity pool. Remember your pool can be withdrawn at any time.
    
    THAT'S NOT ALL
    We have many more features planned for the GMR token. We would like to keep some a surprise.
