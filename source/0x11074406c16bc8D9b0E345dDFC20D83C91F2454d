/**
 * Defina Finance is an online blockchain game that utilizes and combines decentralized finance (Defi) and NFT to allow players to own their gaming assets and monetize them through playing and training.
 * Definaâ€™s vision is to bring blockchain to millions of players, allowing them to explore a new form of gaming through blockchain technology.
 * $FINA is BEP-20 governance and utility token for the Defina ecosystem. There are multiple use cases for $FINA and it plays a very important role in both gaming and community governance.
 * The Defina team is planning to adopt a governance system to allow Defina Finance to become a decentralized autonomous organization. $FINA will be the governance token for the community to do proposal votings.

/**
 * @dev Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.
 *
 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
 * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.
 * For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.
 *
 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
 * https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
 * to implement supply mechanisms].
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead
 * of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional
 * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.
