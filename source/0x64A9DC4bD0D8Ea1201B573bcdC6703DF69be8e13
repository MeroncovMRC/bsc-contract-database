    Developing next-generation DAO platform for freelancers, cutting edge blockchain technology, DeFi and NFT solutions.
    Revolutionizing B2C/C2C model through leveraging the utility of Web 3.0.
    Bringing a new perspective to the global e-commerce market.

    Technology
    Busy DAO is a decentralized distributed solution leveraging blockchain technology in multiple cases. In the first case, a decentralized platform for freelancers will be built. The Web 3.0 engine will be distributed to everyone who will see an advantage in it through smart contracts.

    Blockchain
    Busy technology uses blockchain solutions as a basis. It uses its own proof of stake consensus, where users who verify the authenticity of blocks are randomly selected. Everything goes fast and the data is immediately written to the block.
    This process ensures a high level of security and prevents the so-called double-spending. This system also contributes to overall decentralization, as each active user is part of the network. These features ensure high the throughput of the entire network.

    Busy technology
    This unique model represents the developed Busy technology, which will be applicable to other B2C/C2C platforms through smart contracts.
    The developed Busy DAO brings a comprehensive Web 3.0 solution and a decentralized freelance platform.
    Utility staking is an innovative blockchain feature that will give the real use case of the staking model with platform space occupation and generated reward.

    High volatile market
    The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile. There is too much information to process to execute a profitable trade and humans have a very limited data processing power.
    Market open 24/7
    The cryptocurrency market remains open 24/7, so no one can monitor all the time in front of the computer, and you may miss opportunities while you sleep.
    Unregulated firms taking custody of your funds
    Most fund management firms are not regulated and ask investors to deposit their cryptos to the company's wallet which increases the risk of being a victim of a Ponzi scheme.
