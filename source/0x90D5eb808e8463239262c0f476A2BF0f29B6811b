Description of the contract:

The Raddix Hodl token is an ERC20 token with the special feature that it always has an intrinsic value. 
For each individual token, the intrinsic value must be deposited, then a token is minted. 
In this case, it is BUSD that each token is backed with. 
Another special feature is that the value of a token cannot decrease, but it can increase. 
If you bought the token for 0.01 BUSD, you can be sure that this value will always be deposited for this token. 
Because 1% of the amount of token is burned with every transaction, 
the value of a single token will always increase. 
If the number of tokens sent is higher than 100000 RHT, the fee is 0.1%. 
For everything above 1000000 RHT tokens, 0.05% is burned.
The contract is written so that nothing can remove the value of your token except your token itself.
When you mint tokens, you are credited with 95.5% of the value of the tokens, 
the other 4.5% of the value is credited to the owner of the contract, 
to create LP tokens that can be traded on exchanges. Since the token has a direct value attached to it, 
this minting fee is necessary to start the whole system, as only active trading brings an increase in value.
In addition, a mechanism is launched that creates the deposited value of Imaginary Tokens, 
and burns them within 9 weeks. After these 9 weeks, you can redeem your token in the Contract for the full amount.
As long as the totalSupply is below 5000000 tokens (which corresponds to 500000 BUSD at the beginning), 
there is still no "imaginary burn" everything minted above that has the 9 weeks runtime until the full value. 
If it is paid out before then, the remaining value goes into the pool and to the owner of the contract.
The burn mechanism is the reason why the token is a Hodl token. 
The value of a token is calculated based on the total amount of tokens and the BNB deposited in the contract. 
This is then also always the purchase value, so logically the purchase value of a token also increases.
This ensures that the value of a token is maintained and can therefore only increase, 
which happens when someone trades in their tokens before the imagine burn expires, 
through normal trading because the 1% burned, or when someone burns their tokens themselves.
In summary, the risk of loss is minimal (unless BUSD crashes), 
if you wait you will lose a maximum of 4.5% (if you minted. You can also buy also on Exchanges), 
should you be the only one invested in this token. On the other hand, 
if you buy the token below its intrinsic value on the exchange, or sell it above its intrinsic value, 
you can be sure of making a profit.
So if you plan to just leave your BUSD on your wallet anyway, you can invest in this token as well. 
I have made this contract as open and transparent as I could and wish us all success with the system I have devised. 


How to mint RHT:

1. Go to "Read Contract" and copy the RHT Contract, next click on Contract BUSD.

2. In the BUSD Contract go to Contract -> Write Contract -> approve -> paste the RHT Contract in _spender,
   now insert your amount you want to mint in BUSD. For example:  25 BUSD = 25000000000000000000.
   Click on Connect to Web3 (Red Dot) choose your Wallet and enter. -> Click on "Write" by "approve".

3. Now go back to the RHT Contract and go to Write. Connect to Web3 as same as before.
   Insert the same amount of BUSD in BuyRHT and click on "Write". Done



tokenBurns              	        - Array with the tokens in the Burning mechanism. timeLeft is seconds.
                                      enter 0 to see which is the oldest burn order and when it expires. 

buyRHT                              - buy RHT for your value RHT, you do not need a BurnTokenTrigger beforehand, 
                                       the token value is always calculated live. please put a dot, 
                                       otherwise the transaction will fail. e.g. 0.01 (BNB).

showRHTvalueForBuy                  - Value for a token if you want to buy some.

showRHTvalueForSell                 - Value for a token if you want to sell some.

TriggerForShowAllUpdated            - costs the transaction fee once, but should ensure that all data is updated.

Burn                                - You can burn your own token if you like.

sellRHT                             - Burn your amount of tokens, the contract sends them the corresponding value: 
                                      = (showRHTvalueForSell) * TokenAmount. Only whole Number(s) for selling.

sellRHTforOwnerOfRHTcontract        - is the same as described above, except that I sell directly, 
                                      without waiting (simplifies administration).

showAllRHTinBurningMechanism        - Shows the total amount of tokens that are currently being burned.

showRHTvalueForSellwithoutTrigger   - Show you the Sell Price. As this worked rather unreliably, 
                                      I added the trigger function.

showRHTvalueForBuywithoutTrigger    - Show you the Buy Price. As this worked rather unreliably, 
                                      I added the trigger function.
                                    
totalSupplyWholeNumber              - Shows the number of tokens as a whole number. 
                                      (otherwise you have to subtract 18 digits. this is just for clarity).

tokenBurnsLenght                    - How many TokenBurn processes are running? 
                                      So that you know how long the array is.

AmountYouGetForBUSDwhenMinting      - Amount you get for the Insert BUSD when minting. 
                                      So that you can calculate better.

transferExactDest                   - The recipient receives the specified amount of tokens, 
                                      the fee is deducted from the sender's account.

transferExactDestFrom               - The same of "transferOf", but the recipient receives the specified amount of tokens, 
                                      the fee is deducted from the sender's account.

getReceivedAmount                   - A query function that returns the number of tokens a recipient receives,
                                      when the entered amount of tokens are sent.

getSendAmount                       - Returns the number of tokens that the sender must send, 
                                      if it wants the receiver to receive exactly the amount of tokens entered.

balanceOfWithoutFee                 - Returns the amount of tokens that are in the account as a balance, 
                                      minus the fee if you want to send the total amount.
