The best way to achieve this is by\n * using `public constant` hash digests:\n *\n * ```\n * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\"MY_ROLE\");\n * ```\n *\n * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a\n * function call, use {hasRole}:\n *\n * ```\n * function foo() public {\n *     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));\n *     ...\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and\n * {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only\n * accounts that have a role\u0027s admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.\n *\n * By default, the admin role for all roles is `ADMIN_ROLE`, which means\n * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other\n * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using\n * {_setRoleAdmin}.\n *\n * WARNING: The `ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to\n * grant and revoke this role.

When associated with another contract (the managed \n * contract, which holds a reference to this contract\u0027s address), the managed contract manages its own security \n * by calling this contract\u0027s hasRole function. Then security for that contract is managed by using this contract\u0027s\n * grantRole, revokeRole, and renounceRole functions. \n * \n * This contract can manage security for multiple contracts at once. \n * \n * @author John R.
