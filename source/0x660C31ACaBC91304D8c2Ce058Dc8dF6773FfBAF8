//This contract compliments contract TJJCcRdGHpjJUPDGTwCJp5CAPNqJMVdGfR on the Tron network. We are issuing 10B tokens on this contract. They are part of the 10B tokens issued on the Tron contract.  This token is meant to be a temporary token till we issue the Futira Coin on the Futira Chain once we build the blockchain supporting our telecommunications networks. Initial investors that founded Futira Ltd LLC in Georgia and Futira s.r.o. in Slovakia are awarded shares that have a one year vesting period 10% released for trading on June 25, 2022; 45% released on October 25, 2022 and 45% released on February 25, 2023. Some investors bought before the deployment of this contract on the Binance chain and will have their tokens not trading till April 25, 2022.
//The total number of Futira Tokens and Futira Coins that are authorized to be issued and trading will not exceed 20B. Futira Ltd LLC and Futira s.r.o. reserve the right to burn the tokens in the original pools at their own discretion.
//The Tron contract was deployed on Jan 1, 2022 and had the issue that we only controlled the escrow via having the right to freeze the accounts holding the Futira token. This is undesirable in the long term.
//We intend to bridge the Futira Token on the Tron network with this one on the Binance network.
//This token is temporary. It is the equivalent of one Futira Coin. Once the Futira Coin is launched and trading, all token holders are encouraged to swap them for coins. 
//Futira Ltd LLC and Futira s.r.o. assure a smooth conversion to the coin. Token holders can return the token to an account that will be posted on futiracoin.com to receive the same amount in coins.
//There are many restrictions on the trading of these coins. 
//Those that helped found the company and the early investors will be restricted in selling or transferring for up to one year after launch. 
//Those buying in the early days of the contract whilst things are uncertain  will be not allowed to sell or transfer their token for two months after launch. 
//Those buying after three weeks of the deployment of the contract can sell and transfer immediately after launch.
//There may never be a market for these tokens. We are working diligently to list the token on swap exchanges and to establish a value for them in the market. We cannot guarantee that these efforts will succeed. We will endeavour to generate demand for the token and the coin.
//The issuance of tokens from the main account requires the approval of multiple signatories.
//There is an authorized maximum of twenty billion tokens and coins combined.
//The net proceeds of the sale of the tokens and coins will be used to finance mobile operator networks in developing countries as per www.inovatian.com.
//Please regularly check www.futiracoin.com for updates.
//Together to the moon and beyond!

/**
 * @dev Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.
 *
 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
 * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.
 * For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.
 *
 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
 * https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
 * to implement supply mechanisms].
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
 * instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless
 * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
 * applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.
