//FOREST TOKEN the foremost Eco-friendly Cryptocurrency 

//FOREST TOKEN token is a new project created on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), scalable, high-throughput protocol, powered by a BEP-20 token which is used for various forms of participation in the network (staking, transacting, voting & governance).

//What generates interest about Forest Token, is it moves far beyond any traditional cryptocurrency, having also the potential to contribute to substantially reduce the environmental impact and the carbon footprint.

//FOREST TOKEN strives to become the principal token involved in climate change, so if you care about the planet and want to truly make a difference, this is your chance!!

//The goal of FOREST TOKEN token is to contrast the carbon emission of blockchain technology, through several initiatives worldwide, as well as partnership with no-profit associations and engineering firms involved to develop new technologies in this sense. The FOREST team and community as a whole, really believe in achieving these goals.

//LET’S ACHIEVE OUR PURPOSE TOGETHER

//PLANT the foremost Eco-friendly Cryptocurrency ❗

//How To buy?

//The token is on PancakeSwap V2!

//Make sure to increase slippage between 1-12% due to constant demand!
