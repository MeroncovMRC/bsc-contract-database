/**
* This smart contract will initially hold 20% of Tweetcoin supply. 50 weeks to release all tokens (0.4% of total supply each week). Once that is depleted we will reward our TweetToEarn program with other currency.
* 0.2% will be used to reward community members who take part of our TweetToEarn program. The remaining 0.2% will be used exclusively for centralized exchange listings, bridges, liquidity pools in the future.
* This contract can only withdraw tokens once per week and can't be modified after vesting have began.
