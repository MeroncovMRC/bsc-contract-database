///////////////////////THETAN ARENA////////////////////////

/////////////A KEY DRIVER OF VALUE WITHIN THE UNIVERSE OF THETAN ARENA IS THE MONETARY REWARD SYSTEM
DELIVERED VIA ROBUST, WELL-BALANCED ECONOMICS, SUPPORTED BY BOTH IN-GAME AND
BLOCKCHAIN MECHANICS. A SUPPLEMENTAL OBJECTIVE OF THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM IS TO
DRIVE REAL-WORLD HUMAN INNOVATION AND PROGRESS BY LEVERAGING THIS VIRTUAL WORLD AS
AN EXPERIMENTAL SANDBOX FOR ECONOMIC AND GOVERNANCE RESEARCH. THETAN ARENA IS DRIVEN
BY A DUAL TOKEN SYSTEM (ARENA | BATTLE), WITH MULTI-CURRENCY BINANCE ASSET SUPPORT////////////////

//////////////ARENA WILL SERVE AS THE NATIVE IN-GAME CURRENCY WITHIN THETAN ARENA. IT IS THE
LUBRICANT OF THE METAVERSE. PLAYERS WILL INITIALLY LEVERAGE ARENA TO ACQUIRE DIGITAL
ASSETS SUCH AS WEAPON, LEGEND, CREW AND EQUIPMENT. HOWEVER, AS IN ANY
REAL ECONOMY, A FINANCIAL SYSTEM IS NECESSARY TO FACILITATE COMMERCE. WHETHER IT
BE THROUGH NPC MERCHANTS, OR DIRECT PEER-TO-PEER TRANSACTIONS, ATLAS IS THE UNIT
OF ACCOUNT TO EXECUTE OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS.
OPERATING A BUSINESS IS CHALLENGING. MANAGING RESOURCES WILL REQUIRE CRITICAL
STRATEGIC DECISION MAKING. 
PLAYERS SEEKING THE MONETARY REWARDS AVAILABLE INGAME WILL NEED TO CAREFULLY BALANCE THEIR OPERATING EXPENSES AGAINST INCOME
DERIVED. OPERATING EXPENSES, SUCH AS PERSONNEL FOR MINING EQUIPMENT, FUEL FOR
WEAPON, AND REPAIRS FOR DAMAGES WILL ALL NEED TO BE PAID IN THETAN. IT WILL ALSO SERVE
AS THE PREDOMINANT CURRENCY WITHIN THE NFT MARKETPLACE.///////////////
