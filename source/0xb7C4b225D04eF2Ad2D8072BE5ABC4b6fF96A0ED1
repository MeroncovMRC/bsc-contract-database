* and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.
*
* Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
* This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
* by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
* these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
*
* Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
* functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
